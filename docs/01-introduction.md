# Introduction to Docker Product Catalog Service

Welcome to this comprehensive Docker workshop! You'll learn container technology by working with a real-world Node.js application that demonstrates modern microservices architecture.

## Application Architecture

The Product Catalog Service is a full-stack application that includes:

- **🚀 Node.js API Service** - RESTful catalog management
- **🐘 PostgreSQL Database** - Product data persistence  
- **📊 Kafka Message Streaming** - Event-driven architecture
- **☁️ S3 Storage** - Product image storage (via LocalStack)
- **🔍 Database Visualizer** - pgAdmin for database inspection
- **📈 Kafka Visualizer** - Real-time message monitoring

## What You'll Learn

### Docker Fundamentals
- Container orchestration with Docker Compose
- Multi-service application deployment
- Volume and network management
- Environment configuration

### Real-World Development
- Debugging containerized applications
- Service-to-service communication
- Database integration in containers
- Message queue implementation

### Production-Ready Skills
- Health checks and monitoring
- Log aggregation and debugging
- Performance optimization
- Security best practices

## Workshop Scenario

You're a developer who needs to:
1. **Set up** a complex development environment quickly
2. **Debug** a production issue with missing data in Kafka messages
3. **Test** your fix across multiple services
4. **Validate** the complete application stack

## Prerequisites

- Basic Docker knowledge (containers, images, commands)
- Familiarity with Node.js applications
- Understanding of REST APIs
- Basic terminal/command line skills

## Lab Environment

This lab runs entirely in containers, giving you:
- ✅ Consistent environment across all systems
